"Statement: OK - not very good","Components: Not good.  Simply says ""Source NAT"" and ""Destination NAT"" - no explanation or definition of what these mean.  Fig. 1 does not show these, though it is supposed to show the whole system.","Design: Not good.  Entiere HLD consists of one picture without any narrative or explanation.  This is a ""big picture"" of the system, and a rough ""whiteboard"" one at that.  It provides some indication of approaches, but does not say anything about what your design is (as opposed to, say, an alternative design).  Also see ""task decomposition"" comments.","Task Decomposition: I am treating the section entitled ""Component Development Phases"", since it says ""phases"".  It contains a flowchart as Fig. 2, which seems out of place - how is this a ""phase""? There is no mention of Fig.2 anywhere in the text, or description of how it relates to the rest, so I assume it belongs where it is placed: as destination NAT.  I can only assume that you decomposed the system into only two things: source NAT and destination NAT.  This is inadequate.  Will you write code to realize these flowcharts, and if so, where and how will that code by executed?  You mention the PRE_ROUTING hook, but your narrative refers to it in the middle of the description of the algorithm; how does the algorithm even get executed in the first place?","Per-Member: Ok - not great","Timeline: OK","Test Plan: Good","Demo Plan: Not good - a vague narrative split in three table cells.  No details on exactly what action the team will perform during the demo in front of the instructor - nor what instructor will be expcted to observe.  Also, will there be just a single router between source and destination of video flow?  No testing/demo with multiple such routers?","Website: OK","Clarity / Cogency: OK","Integrity / Originality: OK","Comments (if any): ","Score (out of 20): 11",": ","Comments:: "
